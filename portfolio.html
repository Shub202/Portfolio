        Chandrayaan-3 (Devanagari: चंद्रयान-३, transl. Moon-spaceship)[7] is the third and most recent lunar Indian Space Research exploration mission under the Chandrayaan programme of ISRO.[7] It consists of a lander named Vikram and a rover named Pragyan similar to Chandrayaan-2, but does not have an orbiter. Its propulsion module behaves like a communication relay satellite. The propulsion module carries the lander and rover configuration until the spacecraft is in a 100 km lunar orbit.[8][9]

        Following Chandrayaan-2, where a last-minute glitch in the landing guidance software led to the lander crashing after entering lunar orbit, another lunar mission was proposed.[10]
        
        The launch of Chandrayaan-3 took place on 14 July 2023, at 2:35 pm IST[11] and lunar injection of 100 km circular polar orbit was completed successfully as part of phase one.[2][12] The lander and rover are expected to land near the lunar south pole region on 23 August 2023.[13]
        
        The Chandrayaan-3 mission is a stepping stone towards ISRO’s future interplanetary missions. The key idea is technology demonstration of crucial capability to soft land on lunar surface safely that the earlier mission could not achieve.Background
        As part of the Chandrayaan programme to demonstrate soft landing on the Moon, ISRO launched Chandrayaan-2 on board a Launch Vehicle Mark-3 (LVM3) launch vehicle consisting of an orbiter, a lander and a rover.[15] The lander was scheduled to touchdown on the lunar surface in September 2019 to deploy the Pragyan rover.[16][17]
        
        The European Space Tracking (ESTRACK) operated by European Space Agency (ESA) will support the mission according to a contract. Under the new cross-support arrangement, ESA tracking support could be provided for upcoming ISRO missions such as those of India’s first human spaceflight programme, Gaganyaan and the Aditya-L1 solar research mission. In return, future ESA missions will receive similar support from ISRO’s own tracking stations.[18]
        
        Objective
        ISRO has set three main objectives for the Chandrayaan-3 mission, which include:
        
        Getting a lander to land safely and softly on the surface of the Moon.
        Observing and demonstrating the rover’s loitering capabilities on the Moon.
        In-site observation & conducting experiments on the materials available on the lunar surface to better understand composition of the Moon.[19]
        Design
        
        Chandrayaan-3 comprises three main components:
        
        Propulsion Module: The propulsion module will carry the lander and rover configuration till 100 km lunar orbit. It is a box-like structure with one large solar panel mounted on one side and a large cylinder on top (the Intermodular Adapter Cone) that acts as a mounting structure for the lander.[9][8]
        
        Lander:The lander is responsible for the soft landing on the Moon. It is also box-shaped, with four landing legs and four landing thrusters of 800 newtons each. It will be carrying the rover and various scientific instruments to perform in-site analysis.
        
        The lander for Chandrayaan-3 will have only four throttle-able engines with thrust valve slew rate changing capabilities, unlike Vikram on Chandrayaan-2 which had five 800 Newtons engines with a fifth one being centrally mounted with a fixed thrust. One of the main reasons of Chandrayaan-2 failure, i.e., attitude increase during camera coasting phase was removed by allowing the lander to control attitude and thrust in all phases of descent. Attitude correction range is increased from 10°/s in Chandrayaan-2 to 25°/s in Chandrayaan-3. Additionally, the Chandrayaan-3 lander will be equipped with a Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) to allow measuring attitude in 3 directions.[20][21] The impact legs have been made stronger compared to Chandrayaan-2 and instrumentation redundancy has been increased. It will target a more precise 4 km (2.5 mi) by 4 km (2.5 mi) landing region based on images previously provided by OHRC on Chandrayaan-2. ISRO improved the structural rigidity, increased polling in instruments, increased data frequency and transmission and added other multiple software and contingency systems, as the lander is designed to withstand failed landing attempt via multiple complicated software simulations.[22][21]</p>
        
        Rover
        
        Six-wheeled design
        Weight of 26 kilograms (57 pounds)
        Range of 500 metres (1,600 ft)
        Dimensions : 917 millimetres (3.009 ft) x 750 millimetres (2.46 ft) x 397 millimetres (1.302 ft)
        The Chandrayaan-3 rover is expected to make a number of important scientific discoveries, including:
        
        The composition of the lunar surface
        The presence of water ice in the lunar soil
        The history of lunar impacts
        The evolution of the Moon’s atmosphere
